Git: For cloning the repository.

Node.js and npm: Required to run a React project. 

- **Git**: For cloning the repository.

- **Node.js and npm**: Required to run a React project.

## Steps to Clone and Run the React Project

1. Clone the Repository

- Open your terminal or command prompt.

- Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project:

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/directory
    ```

- Clone the repository using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/thaminiperera/ecomm.git>
    ```

- Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd ecomm
    ```

2. Install Dependencies

- React projects use npm or yarn to manage dependencies. Run the following command to install all necessary packages:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

 If the project uses Yarn instead of npm, use:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3. Start the Development Server

- Run the following command to start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Or, if using Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. By default, it runs on http://localhost:5173.
