## Steps to Clone and Run the React Project

1. Clone the Repository

- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project:

```cd /path/to/your/directory


Clone the repository using Git:

``` git clone <https://github.com/thaminiperera/ecomm.git>


Navigate into the project directory:

```cd repository-name


2. Install Dependencies

React projects use npm or yarn to manage dependencies. Run the following command to install all necessary packages:

```npm install


If the project uses Yarn instead of npm, use:

```yarn install


3. Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start the development server:

```npm run dev


Or, if using Yarn:

```yarn start


This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. By default, it runs on http://localhost:5173.
